# USAJOBS API Tool

This is a command line application that I created to practice retrieving and manipulating data from a large and complex database API. It uses command line arguments to build the URL search parameters and then formats and displays the data. This project is built in TypeScript with no external dependencies apart from dotenv.

## Usage

`node fetch.js --keyword <keyword> --location "<city, state>" or <ZIP>`  
Shortcuts `--k` and `--l` can be used respectively
